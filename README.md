### Usage
You have 2 way to trigger the action who gonna send the mails, firstly a button appears in order edit at modules tab in backoffice this button send a recall mail for the current order.
The second way is a command line ```module:PaymentRecall:CronSendMail``` when this command is called a mail is sent to each order on status "Not paid" and for who the payment module is on enable payment module
and if the time since order has been placed is greater than defined time. We recommend to set up a cron on the command line to automatise this task.
